## Hotel Booking Analyses
<div><b>Goal</b>: Help City Hotel and Resort mitigate the number of booking cancellation rates and lower revenue</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Project Overview</b>: This project analyzes hotel booking data for both City Hotels and Resort Hotels to identify factors contributing to increased booking cancellation rates. It involves examining booking and cancellation trends across months and years, identifying patterns, benchmarking performance, and analyzing ADR (Average Daily Rates) to uncover correlations with cancellation rates. The analysis also explores other potential reasons for cancellations. Visualizations are created to present these insights, and actionable strategies are proposed to mitigate cancellations and improve overall booking performance. </div>
