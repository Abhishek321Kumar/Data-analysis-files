## Hotel Booking Analyses
<div><b>Goal</b>: Help City Hotel and Resort mitigate the number of booking cancellation rates and lower revenue</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Project Overview</b>: This project analyzes hotel booking data for both City Hotels and Resort Hotels to identify factors contributing to increased booking cancellation rates. It involves examining booking and cancellation trends across months and years, identifying patterns, benchmarking performance, and analyzing ADR (Average Daily Rates) to uncover correlations with cancellation rates. The analysis also explores other potential reasons for cancellations. Visualizations are created to present these insights, and actionable strategies are proposed to mitigate cancellations and improve overall booking performance. </div>

<div><b>Skills</b>:Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualisation</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Technology used</b>:Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Insights</b>:
  <ul>
<li>The primary factor contributing to higher cancellation rates is the higher ADR for both Resort and City Hotels, with Resort Hotels generally having higher ADR than City Hotels. </li>
<li>Portugal has the highest cancellation rates for hotel bookings. </li
<li>The source of booking also appears to be a significant factor, with a higher number of bookings made through online travel agencies, which are associated with higher cancellation rates, while direct bookings account for a much smaller proportion and tend to have lower cancellation rates. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Conclusion</b>:
<ul>
<li>Higher ADR rates are linked to higher cancellation rates. Lowering hotel prices, particularly during weekends and holidays, could be an effective strategy to reduce cancellations.</li>
<li>Enhancing the quality of hotel services, including maintenance, can help minimize cancellations by improving customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>A significant portion of bookings comes through online travel agencies (OTAs), so partnering with reputable OTAs could help boost bookings. Additionally, strengthening marketing efforts could attract more customers and reduce cancellations.</li>
</ul>
