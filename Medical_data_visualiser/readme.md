## Medical data visualisation
<div><b>Goal:</b> Analysing medical data to discover relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Skills:</b> Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data transformation & Data Visualisation</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Technology:</b> Python</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Insights:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Individuals without cardiovascular conditions (cardio = 0) are more likely to be active compared to those with conditions (cardio = 1).</li>  
<li>Higher cholesterol levels are more common in individuals with cardiovascular conditions (cardio = 1) compared to those without.</li>  
<li>Smoking prevalence and alcohol cconsumption is slightly higher among those without cardiovascular conditions, though the difference is not very pronounced</li>
<li>Being overweight is more common in individuals with cardiovascular conditions (cardio = 1), though it is significant in both groups.</li>
<li>Elevated glucose levels are also positively correlated with cardiovascular conditions.Also individuals with high cholesterol also tend to have higher glucose levels.</li>
<li>A moderate positive correlation suggests that people who consume alcohol might also smoke.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>
<div><b>Conlusion:</b> Cholesterol, glucose, and weight are the most significant contributors to cardiovascular conditions. Interventions targeting these factors could reduce risks. </div>
